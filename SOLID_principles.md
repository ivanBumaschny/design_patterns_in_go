Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

=======================

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - A type should only have one reason to change
    - _Separation of Concerns_ - Different types/packages handling different, independent task/problems 
Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
    - Types should be open for extension but close for modification
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - You should be able to substitute an embedding type in place of its embedded parts
Interface Aggregation Principle (ISP)
    - Do not put too much into an interface; split into different interfaces
    - YAGNI - _you aint going to need it_
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    - High-level modules should not depend upon Low-level modules; use abstractions
